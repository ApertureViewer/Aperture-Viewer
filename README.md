# Aperture Viewer: nothing is not possible

**Pushing Visual Boundaries in Second Life & OpenSim**

Aperture Viewer is an advanced, open-source viewer designed for anyone seeking the highest level of visual fidelity and performance in Second Life and OpenSim. While meticulously crafted with tools prized by virtual photographers and videomakers, its enhancements benefit all users who appreciate stunning graphics and artistic control. Designed and maintained by William Weaver, it's built upon the robust Firestorm codebase but offers a distinct, refined experience focused on visual excellence. By integrating cutting-edge rendering techniques, a completely overhauled Phototools system (useful for environment tweaking by anyone!), and numerous user experience improvements, Aperture Viewer provides a powerful, streamlined platform to elevate your virtual world experience, embodying the ethos that **nothing is not possible**.

See the visual quality Aperture Viewer delivers by exploring the creative work of its developer, William Weaver's [YouTube Channel](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2F%40colorscompletely%2Ffeatured) and photobooks:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Disclaimer:** Aperture Viewer is an independent project and is not supported by Linden Lab or the Firestorm Viewer Project. While built on open-source code, it offers a unique feature set and development direction. Users should ensure their system meets requirements and understand that features may differ from other viewers.
>*   **Open Source Foundation:** Derived from the official [Second Life](https://github.com/secondlife/viewer) client (open source since 2007, LGPL license) via the Firestorm Viewer codebase. Aperture Viewer continues this open-source tradition.
>*   **Hardware Considerations:** Advanced visual features may require capable computer hardware for optimal performance, particularly at higher settings.

## Advanced Features for Virtual Creators

Aperture Viewer is engineered to provide sophisticated tools and unparalleled control, empowering creators to achieve their artistic vision. Key advantages include:

*   **Comprehensive Phototools Suite (Exclusive Integration):** Experience the completely redesigned Phototools, an exclusive Aperture Viewer feature. This integrated suite offers direct, granular control over virtually every aspect of your visual environment, including a full **Atmosphere** tab mirroring the Environment Editor, enhanced **Shadows**, **Glow**, **Reflections (SSR, Probes)**, **UI Scaling**, **Hover Height**, **Avatar Complexity**, and much more â€“ all within a unified, streamlined interface unmatched by other viewers.
*   **Master Color & Monochrome:** Utilize the integrated **Saturation Control** (VFX tab) for real-time adjustments from pure grayscale to oversaturated. **Exclusive to Aperture Viewer**, fine-tune black & white conversions and color perception by directly adjusting **Luminance Weights** (R/G/B controls in the Aids tab) for unparalleled artistic results.
*   **Exclusive Real-Time Rendering Controls:** **Only in Aperture Viewer**, manipulate your scene with:
    *   **Fluid Global Animation Speed:** Adjust animation playback with F32 precision.
    *   **Dynamic SSAO Sample Count:** Dramatically enhance ambient occlusion quality (potentially **up to 120x improvement**) by directly controlling sample counts in real-time.
    *   **Enhanced SSAO Saturation:** Fine-tune the color intensity of SSAO effects. *
*   **Professional UI & Themes:** Work within a refined user interface featuring four exclusive dark themes (**Nocturn, Dusk, Phantom, Umbra**) with original artwork, modernized default settings for a cleaner look (horizontal chat tabs, timed name tags, hidden chat bar), an enhanced navigation bar, and removed distractions (no MOTD, no screen shake, disabled beam selectors/mouse look). The default "Dusk" theme provides a professional aesthetic out-of-the-box.
*   **Enhanced Performance & Privacy:** Benefit from significantly **faster startup times** (now further improved by **disabling hardware probes and benchmarks**), modernized network defaults (higher bandwidth, larger caches), maximized background CPU yielding, and a strong commitment to user privacy with **dynamic data downloads disabled**, default **local chat logging** enabled, and **voice chat/lookat targets disabled** by default.
*   **Creator-Focused Enhancements:** Enjoy numerous quality-of-life improvements like the global **Fullbright Enable/Disable** toggle, **Unrestricted Volume LOD Factor** (up to 16x for finer detail), **removed object drag/select distance limits**, **4K login screen support**, sensible **3D mouse defaults** (ensuring Phototools Zoom and camera roll work out-of-the-box), improved shadow/SSAO consistency in high-res snapshots, and more.

## Credits

Aperture Viewer is built upon the robust foundation laid by the **Firestorm Viewer Project**. This independent project would not be possible without the immense and ongoing work of the Firestorm team in creating and maintaining their open-source viewer codebase. We gratefully acknowledge their significant contributions to the Second Life and OpenSim communities.

We also extend our sincere appreciation to **Linden Lab** for their foundational commitment to open source and for creating the Second Life platform that enables independent projects like Aperture Viewer to flourish.

Aperture Viewer is maintained by William Weaver. The advanced Phototools system, a core component, builds upon the original Phototools design by William Weaver.
