> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Disclaimer:** Aperture Viewer is an independent project and is not supported by Linden Lab or the Firestorm Viewer Project. While built on open-source code, it offers a unique feature set and development direction. Users should ensure their system meets requirements (Windows 64-bit with AVX) and understand that features may differ from other viewers.
>*   **Open Source Foundation:** Derived from the official [Second Life](https://github.com/secondlife/viewer) client via the Firestorm Viewer codebase. Aperture Viewer continues this open-source tradition.
>*   **Hardware Considerations:** Advanced visual features, especially the Post-Processing pipeline and higher Graphics Preset levels, may require capable computer hardware for optimal performance.

## Credits

Aperture Viewer is built upon the robust foundation laid by the **Firestorm Viewer Project**. This independent project would not be possible without the immense and ongoing work of the Firestorm team in creating and maintaining their open-source viewer codebase. We gratefully acknowledge their significant contributions to the Second Life and OpenSim communities.

We also extend our sincere appreciation to **Linden Lab** for their foundational commitment to open source and for creating the Second Life platform that enables independent projects like Aperture Viewer to flourish.

Aperture Viewer is maintained by William Weaver. The advanced Phototools system, Post-Processing pipeline, Procedural Stars, Graphics Level system, and Camera Preset systems build upon original concepts and design work by William Weaver.
