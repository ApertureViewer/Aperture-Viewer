Your adherence to these guidelines helps us maintain a healthy, productive, and welcoming project.

## Getting Started with Code Contributions

### Prerequisites

*   Familiarity with C++, GLSL shaders, and Git.
*   A working build environment for Second Life viewers (CMake-based). Refer to general Firestorm or Second Life viewer build guides for initial setup if needed. *(Consider linking to a `BUILDING.md` in your repo if you create one with Aperture-specific setup notes).*
*   An IDE or text editor of your choice. Configure your editor to use spaces for indentation.

### Forking and Cloning

1.  **Fork** the `ApertureViewer/Aperture-Viewer` repository to your own GitHub account.
2.  **Clone** your fork to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Aperture-Viewer.git
    cd Aperture-Viewer
    ```
3.  **Add the upstream repository** to keep your fork synced:
    ```bash
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/ApertureViewer/Aperture-Viewer.git
    ```

### Branching Strategy

*   **ALL Aperture-specific development happens on branches created from `dev`.**
*   Before starting any new work, ensure your local `dev` branch is up-to-date with `upstream/dev`:
    ```bash
    git checkout dev
    git fetch upstream
    git rebase upstream/dev # Preferred to keep history clean, or use 'git merge upstream/dev'
    git push origin dev --force-with-lease # If rebased, otherwise 'git push origin dev'
    ```
    *(Note: `rebase` rewrites history. If you're collaborating on a `dev` branch with others on your fork, coordinate or use `merge`.)*
*   Create a new feature or fix branch from `dev`:
    *   For new features: `git checkout -b feature/your-descriptive-feature-name`
    *   For bug fixes: `git checkout -b fix/issue-number-or-description`
*   **NEVER commit directly to `master` or `dev` in your local repository if you intend to PR from it. Always use a feature/fix branch.** The `master` branch in `ApertureViewer/Aperture-Viewer` is for pristine upstream Firestorm code.

## Making Changes (Code Contributions)

### Coding Conventions

1.  **Aperture Commenting Style (Mandatory for all Aperture-specific code):**
    *   Multi-line Aperture-specific code blocks:
        ```cpp
        // <AP:YOUR_TAG>
        // Your new code or detailed explanation here...
        // ...more lines if needed.
        // </AP:YOUR_TAG>
        ```
        Replace `YOUR_TAG` with your initials or GitHub username (e.g., `<AP:JD>` for John Doe). The project lead uses `<AP:WW>`.
    *   Single-line Aperture-specific changes:
        ```cpp
        int example = oldValue; // <AP:JD/> Changed for new feature X.
        ```
    *   When modifying/replacing existing Firestorm/Linden Lab code, comment out the original within `<FS:YOUR_TAG>...</FS:YOUR_TAG>` blocks:
        ```cpp
        // <FS:JD>
        // original_firestorm_code_line_1();
        // original_firestorm_code_line_2();
        // </FS:JD>
        // <AP:JD>
        my_new_aperture_code();
        // </AP:JD>
        ```
    *   **Rationale:** Clear attribution and differentiation of Aperture code from upstream code is critical for maintainability, understanding, and potential future merges or PRs.
2.  **General Code Style:**
    *   **Indentation: Use spaces, not tabs.** This aligns with Linden Lab and Firestorm coding conventions. Configure your editor accordingly (typically 4 spaces per indent level, but match existing code).
    *   Follow the existing style in the Firestorm codebase for other aspects like bracing, spacing around operators, and naming conventions for consistency.
    *   When in doubt, prioritize clarity and readability.
    *   For general good practices in viewer development, we also recommend reviewing the [Firestorm Pull Request Guidelines](https://github.com/FirestormViewer/phoenix-firestorm/blob/master/doc/FS_PR_GUIDELINES.md), though Aperture-specific guidelines in *this* document (especially commit messages and Aperture commenting) take precedence.
3.  **File Type Specific Commenting (General Comments):**
    *   `.cpp`, `.h`, `CMakeLists.txt`, `.rc`: Use `//`
    *   `.py`: Use `#`
    *   `.sh`: Use `#`
    *   `.nsi`: Use `;` or `#`

Feature: Add exposure compensation slider to Phototools

This commit introduces a new slider for exposure compensation within the
Aperture Phototools Suite (APS). This allows users to make real-time
adjustments to the overall brightness of the scene before other post-processing
effects are applied.

The slider ranges from -2.0 to +2.0 EV. The shader uniform apExposureCompensation
has been added to the main post-processing shader.

Addresses request in Issue #42.

Testing:
- Open Phototools (Ctrl+Shift+P).
- Navigate to the "Tone Mapping" section.
- Verify the "Exposure Comp" slider is present.
- Move the slider left and right. Confirm the scene brightness changes accordingly.
- Test with various EEP settings and windlights.
- Ensure the value is saved and restored correctly with Graphics Presets.
- Tested on Windows 10, NVIDIA GTX 1080.

Documentation:
- Update Phototools wiki page to document the new Exposure Compensation slider.
- Add to tutorial on basic image adjustments.

```
